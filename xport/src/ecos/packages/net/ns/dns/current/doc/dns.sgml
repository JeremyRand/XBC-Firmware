<TITLE>DNS API</TITLE>
<PARA>The DNS client uses the normal BSD API for performing lookups:
<function>gethostbyname()</function> and
<FUNCTION>gethostbyaddr()</FUNCTION>.
</PARA>
<PARA>There are a few restrictions:</PARA>
<ITEMIZEDLIST>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>Only IPv4 is supported, ie IPv6 addresses cannot be looked
up.</PARA>
</LISTITEM>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>If the DNS server returns multiple authoritive records
for a host name, the hostent will only contain a record for the
first entry.</PARA>
</LISTITEM>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>The code has been made thread safe. ie multiple threads
may can 
<FUNCTION>gethostbyname()</FUNCTION>
 without causing problems to the hostent structure returned. What
is not safe is one thread using both 
<FUNCTION>gethostbyname()</FUNCTION>
 and 
<FUNCTION>gethostbyaddr()</FUNCTION>.
A call to one will destroy the results from the previous call
to the other function.</PARA>
</LISTITEM>
</ITEMIZEDLIST>
<PARA>To initialise the DNS client the following function must be
called:</PARA>
<PROGRAMLISTING>#include &lt;network.h&gt;
int cyg_dns_res_init(struct in_addr &ast;dns_server)</PROGRAMLISTING>
<PARA>where dns_server is the address of the DNS server
the client should query. On Error this function returns -1, otherwise
0 for success. If lookups are attemped before this function has
been called, they will fail and return NULL.</PARA>
<PARA>The DNS client understands the concepts of the target being
in a domain. By default no domain will be used. Host name lookups
should be for fully qualified names. The domain name can be set
using the function <function>setdomainname()</function>.
Once set, the DNS client will first perform a lookup with the domain
name appended. If this fails it will then perform a second lookup
without the appended domain name. </PARA>
